# Spark and Hadoop in Docker Swarm

# Prerequisites
 - docker (version 18.0 or higher)
 - docker-compose (1.20 or higher)

# Usage
## 1 Swarm manager
To initialize the swarm setup run:
```console
foo@bar:~$ docker swarm init

Swarm initialized: current node (hzywvwt5zygzctmrv4k1hrjfp) is now a manager.

To add a worker to this swarm, run the following command:

    docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-3hlnrriihgjm4ajgmk8drpe5my7kzprtjmgh2qrh8akw64jy98-6vrrb008zo22sk76lr4c7q2qb 10.14.0.164:2377

To add a manager to this swarm, run 'docker swarm join-token manager' and follow the instructions.
```

Your system will be the Swarm manager node. Take a note of the **token** generated by this command. You will use this token if you want to add other nodes to the Swarm cluster.


## 2 Create an overlay and cluster networks
```console
foo@bar:~$ docker network create --ingress --driver overlay ingress
foo@bar:~$ docker network create -d overlay --attachable spark-net
```
If you get an warning about the existing ingress network, just ignore it.

## 3 Pull the Docker images
Sometimes the Docker images are not pulled automatically. It is better that you download them before deploying the services.
```console
foo@bar:~$ docker pull fdiblen/spark-master-dirac && docker pull fdiblen/spark-worker-dirac && docker pull fdiblen/hadoop  
```

## 4 Create services
To deploy Spark and Hadoop services run:
```console
foo@bar:~$ docker stack deploy --resolve-image always -c spark-swarm.yml spark
```
Depending on your system or Docker version you may get an error. In this case try the following command:
```console
foo@bar:~$ docker stack deploy -c spark-swarm.yml spark
```

## 5 Web interfaces
You can now access to the web interface of the created services:

Spark interface [http://0.0.0.0:8080/](http://0.0.0.0:8080)

Hadoop interface [http://0.0.0.0:8088](http://0.0.0.0:8088)

Hadoop datanodes [http://0.0.0.0:50070](http://0.0.0.0:50070)


# Scaling the services
Number of available Spark workers can easily be scaled up/down. In order to have 4 Spark worker nodes run:
```console
foo@bar:~$ docker service scale spark_worker=4
```

# Info about the services
List the services:
```console
foo@bar:~$ docker stack services spark
```
List the tasks:
```console
foo@bar:~$ docker stack ps spark
```
```console
foo@bar:~$ docker network inspect docker_gwbridge | egrep 'Name|IPv4>
```

# Stopping the services
```console
foo@bar:~$ docker stack rm spark
```

# Debugging

You can check the logs
```console
foo@bar:~$ docker logs -f container_name
```

The container name can be found by
```console
foo@bar:~$ docker stack ps spark
```
